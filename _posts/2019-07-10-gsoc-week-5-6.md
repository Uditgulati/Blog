## Introduction

It's 2 more weeks into my GSoC working on [NumRuby](https://github.com/SciRuby/numruby). I worked on adding slicing support and integrate slicing in iterators. Slicing is a crutial feature of a matrix library and must be efficiently implemented as it acts as base for many other operations. So, in order to write an efficient implementation I went through NumPy's resources on slicing and also through their implementation of slicing. After reading resources on slicing, I came up with an implementation which would use indexing to traverse only those elements which are part of slice.

## Broadcasting

**What is broadcasting?**

Wikipedia defines slicing as an operation that extracts a subset of elements from an array and packages them as another array, possibly in a different dimension from the original [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_slicing)]. For slicing in NMatrix, the definition would be same with "array" replaced with "matrix". 



Corresponding pull requests can be found here at [https://github.com/SciRuby/numruby/pull/19](https://github.com/SciRuby/numruby/pull/19) and [https://github.com/SciRuby/numruby/pull/22](https://github.com/SciRuby/numruby/pull/22). 

For coming weeks, I'll complete the above remaining iterators and start work on slicing and broadcasting. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section. Thanks for reading.
