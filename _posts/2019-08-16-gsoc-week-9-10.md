## Introduction

During these period, I continued the work on Linear algebra functionalities of [NumRuby](https://github.com/SciRuby/numruby) to write NumRuby::Linalg. I implemented most of the required wrapper functions and these will now be used to implement NumRuby::Linalg methods. Source code of numpy.linalg and Numo::Linalg acted as a great resource to get to a good enough implementation of these methods.

Corresponding pull request can be found here at [https://github.com/SciRuby/numruby/pull/30](https://github.com/SciRuby/numruby/pull/30).

After this, I'll work on adding better support sparse matrices and work on cleaning the code, writing tests and fixing minor bugs. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section. Thanks for reading.
