## Shall I?

Shall I say it
Or keep it for myself?
Shall I write it
Or keep it for myself?
Shall I show it
Or keep it for myself?
Shall I free it
Or keep it for myself?

Is it a dream
Or just another nightmare?
Is it a reward
Or just another punishment?
Is it happiness
Or just another misery?
Is it what I want
Or just what I deserve?

Shall I take the risk 
Or be contempt with it?
Shall I set it free
Or be forever with it?
Shall I drink it all
Or be distant from it?
Shall I run towards
Or away from it?

Maybe itâ€™s time to wake up
Or go back to dream?
