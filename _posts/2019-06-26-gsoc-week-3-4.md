## Introduction

It's 2 more weeks into my GSoC working on [NumRuby](https://github.com/SciRuby/numruby). I worked on adding slicing support and integrate slicing in iterators. Slicing is a crutial feature of a matrix library and must be efficiently implemented as it acts as base for many other operations. So, in order to write an efficient implementation I went through NumPy's resources on slicing and also through their implementation of slicing. After reading resources on slicing, I came up with an implementation which would use indexing to traverse only those elements which are part of slice.

## Slicing

**What is slicing?**

Wikipedia defines slicing as an operation that extracts a subset of elements from an array and packages them as another array, possibly in a different dimension from the original [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_slicing)]. For slicing in NMatrix, the definition would be same with "array" replaced with "matrix". 

To retrieve a single value, you use indexing. Similarly, to retrieve a collection of values, you would use slicing. For example,

```ruby
pry -r './lib/nmatrix.rb'
[1] pry(main)> m = NMatrix.new [2, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
=> 
[2] pry(main)> m[0, 0..3].elements
=> [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
[3] pry(main)> m[1, 0..3].elements
=> [5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0]
[4] pry(main)> m[0..1, 0].elements
=> [1.0, 5.0]
[5] pry(main)> m[0..1, 1].elements
=> [2.0, 6.0]
[6] pry(main)> m[0..1, 2].elements
=> [3.0, 7.0]
[7] pry(main)> m[0..1, 3].elements
=> [4.0, 8.0]
```

**Implementation of slicing**

## Using slicing in iterators

I implemented iterators for NMatrix during last week. These also included iterators along a dimension such as `each_row`, `each_column` and `each_layer`. These "along the dimension" iterators were only implemented for 2d matrices as they can't be implemented for n-dimensional matrices without slicing.


```ruby
pry -r './lib/nmatrix.rb'
[1] pry(main)> m = NMatrix.new [2, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
=> 
[2] pry(main)> m.each_row do |x|
[2] pry(main)*   p x.elements
[2] pry(main)* end  
[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
[5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0]
=> 
```

```ruby
pry -r './lib/nmatrix.rb'
[1] pry(main)> m = NMatrix.new [2, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
=> 
[2] pry(main)> m.each_column do |x|
[2] pry(main)*   p x.elements  
[2] pry(main)* end  
[1.0, 5.0]
[2.0, 6.0]
[3.0, 7.0]
[4.0, 8.0]
=> 
```

```ruby
pry -r './lib/nmatrix.rb'
[1] pry(main)> m = NMatrix.new [2, 2, 2], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
=> 
[2] pry(main)> m.each_layer do |x|
[2] pry(main)*   p x.elements  
[2] pry(main)* end  
[1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0]
[2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0]
=> 
```

For coming weeks, I'll complete the above remaining iterators and start work on slicing and broadcasting. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section. Thanks for reading.
