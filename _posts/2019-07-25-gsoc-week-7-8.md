## Introduction

During these weeks, I started work on Linear algebra functionalities of [NumRuby](https://github.com/SciRuby/numruby). This is being done by implementing Linear algebra methods under the module Numruby::LinAlg and these methoda then makes use of LAPACk and BLAS routines but these can't be directly called from Ruby code, so there needs to be some wrappers functions in C which expose these functions to be able to be called from Ruby code. I implemented most of the required wrapper functions and will later use them to implement NumRuby::LinAlg methods. I went through source code of numpy.linalg and Numo::Linalg to have a gist of ways the Linear algebra capabilities could be implemented.

## BLAS and LAPACK

LAPACK and BLAS are libraries for linear algebra functionalities written in FORTRAN and are used as underlying for linear algebra capabilities in nearly every numerical library in modern languages be int NMatrix, Numo in ruby or NumPy in Python and the reason primarily being their performance and efficiency. 

Wikipedia defines BLAS as following, "Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) is a specification that prescribes a set of low-level routines for performing common linear algebra operations such as vector addition, scalar multiplication, dot products, linear combinations, and matrix multiplication. They are the de facto standard low-level routines for linear algebra libraries; the routines have bindings for both C and Fortran. Although the BLAS specification is general, BLAS implementations are often optimized for speed on a particular machine, so using them can bring substantial performance benefits. BLAS implementations will take advantage of special floating point hardware such as vector registers or SIMD instructions." an defines LAPACk as following, "LAPACK (Linear Algebra Package) is a standard software library for numerical linear algebra. It provides routines for solving systems of linear equations and linear least squares, eigenvalue problems, and singular value decomposition. It also includes routines to implement the associated matrix factorizations such as LU, QR, Cholesky and Schur decomposition. LAPACK was originally written in FORTRAN 77, but moved to Fortran 90 in version 3.2 (2008).[1] The routines handle both real and complex matrices in both single and double precision.". One can explore BLAS and LAPACk here at [http://www.netlib.org/blas/](http://www.netlib.org/blas/) and [http://www.netlib.org/lapack/](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/).

## NumRuby::LinAlg



## Wrappers for LAPACK routines


Corresponding pull request can be found here at [https://github.com/SciRuby/numruby/pull/26](https://github.com/SciRuby/numruby/pull/26).

After this, I'll work on implementing linear algebra methods for NumRuby::LinAlg using these wrappers for LAPACK routines. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section. Thanks for reading.
