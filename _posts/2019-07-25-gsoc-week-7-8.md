## Introduction



## LAPACK and BLAS

## NumRuby::LinAlg

## Wrappers for LAPACk routines


Corresponding pull request can be found here at [https://github.com/SciRuby/numruby/pull/26](https://github.com/SciRuby/numruby/pull/26).

After this, I'll work on implementing linear algebra methods for NumRuby::LinAlg using these wrappers for LAPACK routines. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section. Thanks for reading.
